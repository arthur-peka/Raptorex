# TODO (poor man's Scrum board)

## Planned (soon)

* User roles

* User admin panel

* Custom authentication mechanism instead of FormsAuthentication. FormsAuthentication is *really* clumsy.

## Planned (someday)

* Controller tests mocking DA level (when/if there's a logic to test on Controller level)

* Forum themes (different looks)

* Ensure compatability with Mono, so that Raptorex can be run on non-Windows platforms.

## Ideas

* Evaluate transition from Knockout to Angular

* ASP.NET 5 (aka vNext) front-end

## Done
