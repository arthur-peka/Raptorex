Raptorex
========
![Build-status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/nrg04q1r5h1kv4hi?svg=true)

This is a minimalistic open-source forum engine. It's built upon EF 6 (will upgrade when 7 is stable), Web API and Knockout *or* Angular
on the front-end. Code-first database is used to ease the development (and maintenance). xUnit is used for unit tests.

Project's main philosophy (i.e. development approach) is "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler".

## Roadmap

* Unit/Integration tests

* Decision needs to be made what to use - Knockout or Angular. I plan to start with Knockout, as I know it better. Later, possibly
transition to Angular will be made.

* Ensuring compatability with Mono, so that Raptorex can be run on non-Windows platforms.
