Raptorex
========

This is an open-source forum engine. It's built upon EF 6 (will upgrade when 7 is stable), Web API and Knockout *or* Angular
on the front-end. Code-first database is used to ease the development (and maintenance).

## Roadmap

* Unit/Integration tests

* Decision needs to be made what to use - Knockout or Angular. I plan to start with Knockout, as I know it better. Later, possibly
transition to Angular will be made.

* Ensuring compatability with Mono, so that Raptorex can be run on non-Windows platforms.
