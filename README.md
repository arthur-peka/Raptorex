This is a minimalistic open-source forum engine. It's built upon EF 6 (will probably upgrade when 7 is stable), Web API and Knockout *or* Angular
on the front-end. Code-first database is used to ease the development (and maintenance). xUnit is used for unit tests.

Project's main philosophy (i.e. development approach) is "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler".
